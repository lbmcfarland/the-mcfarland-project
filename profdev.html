                <p>Goal setting is the process of deciding what you want to accomplish and devising a plan to achieve the result you desire. For entrepreneurs, goal setting is an important part of business planning. For effective goal setting, you need to do more than just decide what you want to do; you also have to work at accomplishing whatever goal you have set. For many people, it's the third part of the goal-setting definition that's problematic. They know what they want to do, and they're perfectly willing to work on it, but they have trouble creating a plan to get there.</p>
